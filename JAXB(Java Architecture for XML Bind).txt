JAXB(Java Architecture for XML Binding) 
=======================================

(1.8 java version supported)


==> JAXB is a Java standard that defines how Java objects are converted from and to XML. It uses a standard set of mappings.

==> JAXB Marshalling means Converting a Java Object to XML.

==> JAXB Unmarshalling means Converting XML to Java Object.


==> Two important jaxb classes are 
	
	==> Unmarshaller interface is used to convert XML to Java Object.

	==> JAXBContext class is the entry point for JAXB and provides methods to get marshaller and unmarshalled object.



==> javax.xml.bind.annotation package provides classes and interfaces for JAXB 2.0.


==> annotations in the jaxb 

	
	==> @XmlRootElement:-> This is a must have an annotation for the Object to be used in JAXB. It defines the root element for the XML content.

	==> @XmlType :-> We can use it for ordering the XML . It has (PropOrder) parameter in it which will order the Xml in given Format 
	
	==> @XmlTransient :-> This will make sure that the object property is not written in the Xml

	==> @XmlAttribute :-> this will  mark the object property as a xml attribute 
	
	==> @XmlElement :-> (name ="Onkar") this will define the element in  the Xml as we require

	
==> We have to create the object of JAXBContext and then we can use marshaller and unmarshaller
