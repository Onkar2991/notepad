	2> test driven development(writing tests after writing the code to drive the development)
	3> Use sonar cube

	--> check for dependancies if there are any which are affected by this ticket 
	--> break down the task into smaller subtasks 
	--> do the development based on the ticket priority 
	--> testing the functionality by writing unit test cases then do integration testing after that do the User acceptance Testing (UAT) ( to verify the changes meet the acceptance criteria )
	--> then deploy the code to the production 

==> CI-CD pipeline workflow ( for Deployemnt)
	
	--> Build stage ( where we Build and compile our code)
	--> Test Stage ( where we can write the Junit test cases for the code)
	--> Deploy Stage ( where we deploy the code )
