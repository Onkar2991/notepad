		> select public>> table >> select any table >> run a query for selected table >>select fields >> finish 
	 
	==> edit the names which you want (field names must be same as mentioned in the entity class ) 
	
	==> create one file in resource package with name and extension will be jrxml , it will contain the source file of jasper report which we get from jasper reporting tool
	
	==> Add the jasper dependency in pom.xml

	==> remove query string as we dont want to get the data from inbuild db of jasper reporting tool , we want it from our application 

	==> mention all the field names in field tag and mention the class path and datatype in the class variable in field tag i.e (java.lang.String,java.lang.Integer, etc) for each field 

	==> in detail tag , mention the same names as mentioned in the fields section as we have to map it to our application

	==> Create a service for the report 
			
			==> first get all the data of employess or anything whichever you want(List )

			==> then we have to load the jrxml file and compile it
				
				==> File file = resourceUtil.getFile(resourcelocation:"classpath:(name of jrxml file with extension)) to get or load the file 
				
				==> JaperReport jas perreport = JasperCompileManager.compileReport(japerDesign: file.getAbsolutePath()) for compiling the report 	
		
				==> JRBeanCollectionDatasource datasource = new JRBeanCollectionDatasource()
